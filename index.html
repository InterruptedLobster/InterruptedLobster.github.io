          <p>FindAR is an Augmented Reality application that allows a user to find locations on a map, or using their phone's camera, and share those locations with their friends.</p>

          <h2><a class="top" href="#top">Top</a>Why Was This Made?</h2>
          <p>Have you ever had a difficult time meeting a friend for lunch? "I'm at the corner of Turk and Mason," they say. "So am I. I see a shoe store and a jewelry store," you say. "I see those things, but I don't see you. Where are you?"</p>
          <p>These conversations can be a thing of the past. Our app allows you to share a location with your friends, and see it appear over your phone's camera for quicky, efficient navigation.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="how">
          <h2><a class="top" href="#top">Top</a>How Was This Made?</h2>
          <p>We leveraged Facebook's React Native framework to write FindAR almost completely in JavaScript -- but the best thing about React Native is not porting JavaScript to native components, but being able to use the React methodology in writing apps. We used Redux to manage our data flow as well. We hacked together the augmented reality system by overlaying a transparent webview running THREE.js over a react component rendering the phone's native camera.</p>

              <p>My primary goal as a software engineer is to make life easier for other people. This, to me, means being empathetic and giving excellent feedback so that another person can better decide what to do next. Often, this manifests as an end user navigating through an app that I’ve built. Just as important to me is that I think about what kind of experience I am creating for other developers.</p>

              <p>I am a software engineer with a big interest in finding different ways to solve everyday problems. I believe many tasks in life, mundane or not, can be automated using software. I’m interested in all opportunities that allow me to traverse the full stack to bring the most intuitive experience when using an application though I find myself favoring front end UI/UX as I work on applications to bring better functionality to the user.</p>

              <p>I am a full stack software engineer with a strong background in Javascript and an inclination for the front end. I love creating and working with a team who share the same passion of building beautiful, enticing products that solve everyday problems. I am most satisfied when I can contribute to a product that provides an efficient technology-enabled solution.  Recently, I’ve been mastering the MEAN stack as well as exploring new, groundbreaking technology like React.</p>
