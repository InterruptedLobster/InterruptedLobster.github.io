              <p>My primary goal as a software engineer is to make life easier for other people. This, to me, means being empathetic and giving excellent feedback so that another person can better decide what to do next. Often, this manifests as an end user navigating through an app that I’ve built. Just as important to me is that I think about what kind of experience I am creating for other developers.</p>

              <img class="portrait" alt="A picture of Alex Su" src="./assets/alex-su.jpg">
              <p>I am a software engineer with a big interest in finding different ways to solve everyday problems. I believe many tasks in life, mundane or not, can be automated using software. I’m interested in all opportunities that allow me to traverse the full stack to bring the most intuitive experience when using an application though I find myself favoring front end UI/UX as I work on applications to bring better functionality to the user.</p>

              <img class="portrait" alt="A picture of Tiffany Thong" src="./assets/tiffany-thong.jpg">
              <p>I am a full stack software engineer with a strong background in Javascript and an inclination for the front end. I love creating and working with a team who share the same passion of building beautiful, enticing products that solve everyday problems. I am most satisfied when I can contribute to a product that provides an efficient technology-enabled solution.  Recently, I’ve been mastering the MEAN stack as well as exploring new, groundbreaking technology like React.</p>
